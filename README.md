### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

<!-- Actual text -->
To briefly introduce myself, I'm a full-time student currently enrolled in App Academy's full-stack immersive software engineering program! I have a passion for learning all about tech, finance and real estate. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Check out a few of my public projects below to get a sample of what I can do. For the latest and greatest visit my latest projects below:
