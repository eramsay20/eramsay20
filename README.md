### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- Actual text -->
I'm a full-time student enrolled in App Academy's full-stack immersive software engineering program! I have a passion for learning all about tech, finance and real estate. Check out a few of my public projects below to get a sample of what I can do. Coming from an investment analyst background, I lean heavily on simplicity and clarity when problem solving and like to reflect that in my code. 

If you found value in something I have created or have helpful tips on ways to improve, please feel free to send a message and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericramsay/)!
